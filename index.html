						<p>For me, life has always been about letting loose your imagination on the world.  I've often let my imagination swallow me up, and just as often I've wished to turn it back outward, and see what things I could do, what places I can explore, or what ways in which I could shape this universe we live in. It is for this reason, perhaps, that I've always seen technology as something to be embraced, and engage in actively. We our shaping society, the planet, and who knows what else just be reorganizing everything around us into something more...intelligent. I have finally taken my first steps towards the engagement I seek by beginning to learn web development, and I hope to take it much farther.</p>
						<p>Growing up, I always liked the outdoors. I have been an active hiker for as long as I can remember, and the a part of me will always feel most at home in the mountains. It was only natural, then, that in 2013 I would hike the Appalachian Trail; an experience that will always stay fresh in my mind, however much time passes. I have Pacific Crest Trail on the West Coast next, though that may be still some time off. I love to play strategy games, whether with dice and cards and little colourful pieces, with a group of friends at the table, or complex, historical strategy games on my computer. I read a little, usually some form of scif fi or fantasy, and have fallen in love with innumerable shows from the brutally depressive yet addictive Bojack Horseman to brilliant and thrilling Westworld. I am also a lover of film, enjoying modern spectacles such as Bladerunner 2049, and classics including the Seven Samurai, which is truly the most magnificent rendition of that story regardless of what other adaptations might call themselves. I am a vegan as of the summer of 2017, though on a side note a am also a great believer in adopting the Holocene Calendar, which would actually make our current year 12017. I have studied both a little aikido and a little piano, though am woefully out of practice in regards to both - one of those things we always intend to address but rarely do.</p>
						<p>I'll just add that I consider this whole text somewhat of a placeholder.  As I expand my portfolio I'll also revise my biography.</p>
